# :sunny: :umbrella: Travel Boogaloo :cloud: :snowflake:
#TravelBoogaloo is the premier RCB app to store users travel memories. Users will have the privilege of adding the places they’ve been, the pictures they’ve taken, and experiences they never want to forget into a secure, user-friendly web app!



## Overview

#TravelBoogaloo will be a web app that allows users to store their trips. We plan to use Google/Firebase’s authentication library to manage user accounts. Members will be able to add travel albums that logs where they have been, which we will map using Google Maps. User can then enter pictures (or link to an existing album) via Google Picassa.
